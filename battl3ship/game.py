        The rules for shooting and the expected returned values are as follows:

                * A player cannot shot twice in the same square in the same game
                * If no shot hits a boat, both lists are empty
                * If a boat is hit by one or more shots and all its squares are hit,
                  the boat is "sunk" and its length appears in `sunk_length_list`.
                * The length of `sunk_length_list` is equal to the number
                  of boats sunk this turn. If two or more boats of the same length are sunk
                  in this turn, that length appears repeated those many times in
                  `sunk_length_list`.
                * If a boat is hit one or more times this turn but one or more squares
                  remain intact after this turn, it is "hit" (and not "sunk")
                  and its length is added once to `hit_length_list`.
                  For example, if a boat of length 3 is hit by two different shots
                  in a single turn and the third shot does not hit anything, the
                  result in that turn will be ([3], [])
                * If two or more boats of the same length are "hit" (but not "sunk"), their
                  length appears repeated those many times in `hit_length_list`.
